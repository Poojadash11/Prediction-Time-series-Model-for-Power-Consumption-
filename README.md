# Prediction-Time-series-Model-for-Power-Consumption-
Dynamic energy modelling for IT  Sustainability with resulting placement of staff  in the most carbon friendly compute location.
The success of the project was driven by the utilization of a machine learning-based predictive model, enabling us to project future power consumption. Through this projection, we effectively showcased how businesses can take proactive steps to assess and transparently disclose their anticipated carbon emissions while strategically implementing essential measures. 
  
In the course of our study, we embarked on the development of advanced Time Series models, namely the multivariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and Facebook's Prophet 
model, to forecast the power consumption of Novartis IT system. This exploration covered both multivariate and univariate contexts. While the LSTM model demonstrated substantial potential, it encountered challenges stemming from the scarcity of available data, leading to less-than-optimal results. In contrast, the Prophet model emerged as a promising and practical alternative. Considering the limitations imposed by the dataset, the Prophet model stood out as the most effective choice for predicting future power consumption based on historical data. 
  
Furthermore, our analysis extended to the integration of emission factors and real-time power consumption data. By combining these elements, we were able to precisely quantify the carbon emissions generated by the system. This information was then juxtaposed against the baseline emissions provided by the manufacturer. The outcome of this comprehensive comparison unveiled notable disparities in the metrics, providing valuable insights into existing variations and gaps. This achievement solidified our endeavourâ€™s success in not only forecasting power consumption but also in raising awareness about the environmental impact of our operations.
